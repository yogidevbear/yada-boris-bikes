# yada-boris-bikes

A Clojure library designed to ... well, that part is up to you.

## Usage

Using Leiningen, type `lein repl`. Once the REPL is up and running, you should be in the `yada-boris-bikes.main` namespace. Open a browser and go to http://localhost:3000 for the sign in form (still needs completing). Browse to http://localhost:3000/boris-bikes to see a list of the 5 closest bike points to Leyton Orient FC with the number of available bikes at each point.

To stop the server, either run `((:close svr))` from the REPL or simply exit the REPL.
